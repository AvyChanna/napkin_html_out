</span> I am indebted to countless people for this work. Here is a partial (surely incomplete)
list.
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Thanks to all my teachers and professors for teaching me much of the material
     covered in these notes, as well as the authors of all the references I have cited here.
     A special call-out to <span class="cite">[<tspan font-family="cmbx" font-size="10">?</tspan>]</span>, <span class="cite">[<tspan font-family="cmbx" font-size="10">?</tspan>]</span>, <span class="cite">[<tspan font-family="cmbx" font-size="10">?</tspan>]</span>, <span class="cite">[<tspan font-family="cmbx" font-size="10">?</tspan>]</span>, <span class="cite">[<tspan font-family="cmbx" font-size="10">?</tspan>]</span>, <span class="cite">[<tspan font-family="cmbx" font-size="10">?</tspan>]</span>, <span class="cite">[<tspan font-family="cmbx" font-size="10">?</tspan>]</span>, <span class="cite">[<tspan font-family="cmbx" font-size="10">?</tspan>]</span>, <span class="cite">[<tspan font-family="cmbx" font-size="10">?</tspan>]</span>, <span class="cite">[<tspan font-family="cmbx" font-size="10">?</tspan>]</span>, which were especially
     influential.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Thanks also to dozens of friends and strangers who read through preview copies
     of my draft, and pointed out errors and gave other suggestions. Special mention
     to Andrej Vuković and Alexander Chua for together catching over a thousand
     errors. Thanks also to Brian Gu and Tom Tseng for many corrections. (If you find
     mistakes or have suggestions yourself, I would love to hear them!)
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">I’d also like to express my gratitude for many, many kind words I received during
     the development of this project. These generous comments led me to keep working
     on this, and were largely responsible for my decision in November 2018 to begin
     updating the Napkin again.</li></ul>
<!--l. 222--><p class="indent" >  Finally, a huge thanks to the math olympiad community, from which the Napkin (and me)
has its roots. All the enthusiasm, encouragement, and thank-you notes I have received over the
years led me to begin writing this in the first place. I otherwise would never have the
arrogance to dream a project like this was at all possible. And of course I would be nowhere
near where I am today were it not for the life-changing journey I took in chasing my dreams to
the IMO. Forever TWN2!
