<!--l. 158--><p class="noindent" >I began writing this book in December of 2014, after having finished my first semester of
undergraduate at Harvard. It became my main focus for about 18 months after that, as I
became immersed in higher math. I essentially took only math classes, (gleefully ignoring all
my other graduation requirements) and merged as much of it as I could (as well as lots of
other math I learned on my own time) into the Napkin.
</p><!--l. 168--><p class="indent" >  Towards August of 2016, though, I finally lost steam. The first public drafts
went online then, and I decided to step back. Having burnt out slightly, I then
took a break from higher math, and spent the remaining two undergraduate
years<span class="footnote-mark"><a

working extensively as a coach for the American math olympiad team, and trying to spend as
much time with my friends as I could before they graduated and went their own
ways.
</p><!--l. 183--><p class="indent" >  During those two years, readers sent me many kind words of gratitude, many reports of
errors, and many suggestions for additions. So in November of 2018, some weeks into my first
semester as a math PhD student, I decided I should finish what I had started. Some months
later, here is what I have.
