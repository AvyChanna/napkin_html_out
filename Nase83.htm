concretely. But it obfuscates the fact that this map is, well, a map, not an array of
numbers.
</p><!--l. 821--><p class="indent" >  If you took high school precalculus, you’ll see everything done in terms of matrices. To any
typical high school student, a matrix is an array of numbers. No one is sure what exactly these
numbers represent, but they’re told how to magically multiply these arrays to get more arrays.
They’re told that the matrix

Then they’re told that the determinant is some magical combination of these numbers formed
by this weird multiplication rule. No one knows what this determinant does, other than the
fact that det(<tspan font-family="cmmi" font-size="10">AB</tspan>) = det<tspan font-family="cmmi" font-size="10">A</tspan>det<tspan font-family="cmmi" font-size="10">B</tspan>, and something about areas and row operations and Cramer’s
rule.
</p><!--l. 840--><p class="indent" >  Then you go into linear algebra in college, and you do more magic with these arrays of
numbers. You’re told that two matrices <tspan font-family="cmmi" font-size="10">T</tspan><sub><tspan font-family="cmr" font-size="8">1</tspan></sub> and <tspan font-family="cmmi" font-size="10">T</tspan><sub><tspan font-family="cmr" font-size="8">2</tspan></sub> are similar if

sum of the diagonal entries. Somehow this doesn’t change if you look at a similar
matrix, but you’re not sure why. Then you define the characteristic polynomial
as

<!--l. 849--><p class="indent" >  Somehow this also doesn’t change if you take a similar matrix, but now you really don’t
know why. And then you have the Cayley-Hamilton theorem in all its black magic: <tspan font-family="cmmi" font-size="10">p</tspan><sub><tspan font-family="cmmi" font-size="8">T</tspan> </sub>(<tspan font-family="cmmi" font-size="10">T</tspan>) is
the zero map. Out of curiosity you Google the proof, and you find some ad-hoc procedure
which still leaves you with no idea why it’s true.
</p><!--l. 856--><p class="indent" >  This is terrible. What’s so special about <tspan font-family="cmmi" font-size="10">T</tspan><sub><tspan font-family="cmr" font-size="8">2</tspan></sub> = <tspan font-family="cmmi" font-size="10">ST</tspan><sub><tspan font-family="cmr" font-size="8">1</tspan></sub><tspan font-family="cmmi" font-size="10">S</tspan><tspan font-family="cmsy" font-size="8">−</tspan><tspan font-family="cmr" font-size="8">1</tspan>? Only if you know that the matrices
are linear maps does this make sense: <tspan font-family="cmmi" font-size="10">T</tspan><sub><tspan font-family="cmr" font-size="8">2</tspan></sub> is just <tspan font-family="cmmi" font-size="10">T</tspan><sub><tspan font-family="cmr" font-size="8">1</tspan></sub> rewritten with a different choice of
basis.
</p><!--l. 860--><p class="indent" >  I really want to push the opposite view. Linear algebra is the study of <tspan font-family="cmti" font-size="10">linear maps</tspan>, but it is
taught as the study of <tspan font-family="cmti" font-size="10">arrays of numbers</tspan>, and no one knows what these numbers mean. And
for a good reason: the numbers are meaningless. They are a highly convenient way of encoding
the matrix, but they are not the main objects of study, any more than the dates of events are
the main objects of study in history.
</p><!--l. 869--><p class="indent" >  The other huge downside is that people get the impression that the only (real) vector space
in existence is <tspan font-family="msbm" font-size="10">ℝ</tspan><sup><tspan font-family="cmsy" font-size="8">⊕</tspan><tspan font-family="cmmi" font-size="8">n</tspan></sup>. As explained in <tspan font-family="cmbx" font-size="10">??</tspan> , while you <tspan font-family="cmti" font-size="10">can </tspan>work this way if you’re a soulless
robot, it’s very unnatural for humans to do so.
</p><!--l. 875--><p class="indent" >  When I took Math 55a as a freshman at Harvard, I got the exact opposite treatment: we did
all of linear algebra without writing down a single matrix. During all this time I was
quite confused. What’s wrong with a basis? I didn’t appreciate until later that this
approach was the morally correct way to treat the subject: it made it clear what was
happening.
</p><!--l. 883--><p class="indent" >  Throughout the Napkin, I’ve tried to strike a balance between these two approaches, using
matrices when appropriate to illustrate the maps and to simplify proofs, but ultimately
writing theorems and definitions in their <tspan font-family="cmti" font-size="10">morally correct </tspan>form. I hope that this has both the
advantage of giving the “right” definitions while being concrete enough to be digested. But I
                                                                                
                                                                                
would like to say for the record that, if I had to pick between the high school approach and the
55a approach, I would pick 55a in a heartbeat.
