<!--l. 100--><p class="noindent" >I am pathologically obsessed with examples. In this book, I place all examples in large boxes
to draw emphasis to them, which leads to some pages of the book simply consisting of
sequences of boxes one after another. I hope the reader doesn’t mind.
</p><!--l. 105--><p class="indent" >  I also often highlight a “prototypical example” for some sections, and reserve the color red
for such a note. The philosophy is that any time the reader sees a definition or a theorem
about such an object, they should test it against the prototypical example. If the
example is a good prototype, it should be immediately clear why this definition is
intuitive, or why the theorem should be true, or why the theorem is interesting, et
cetera.
</p><!--l. 114--><p class="indent" >  Let me tell you a secret. Whenever I wrote a definition or a theorem in this book, I would
have to recall the exact statement from my (quite poor) memory. So instead I often consider
the prototypical example, and then only after that do I remember what the definition or the
theorem is. Incidentally, this is also how I learned all the definitions in the first place. I hope
you’ll find it useful as well.
