<!--l. 28--><p class="noindent" >The <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">Infinitely Large Napkin </span>is a light but mostly self-contained introduction to a large amount
of higher math.
</p><!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >  I should say at once that this book is not intended as a replacement for dedicated books or
courses; the amount of depth is not comparable. On the flip side, the benefit of this “light”
approach is that it becomes accessible to a larger audience, since the goal is merely to give the
reader a feeling for any particular topic rather than to emulate a full semester of
lectures.
</p><!--l. 40--><p class="indent" >  I initially wrote this book with talented high-school students in mind, particularly those
with math-olympiad type backgrounds. Some remnants of that cultural bias can still be felt
throughout the book, particularly in assorted challenge problems which are taken from
mathematical competitions. However, in general I think this would be a good reference for
anyone with some amount of mathematical maturity and curiosity. Examples include but
certainly not limited to: math undergraduate majors, physics/CS majors, math PhD students
who want to hear a little bit about fields other than their own, advanced high schoolers
who like math but not math contests, and unusually intelligent kittens fluent in
English.
