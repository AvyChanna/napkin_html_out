<!--l. 656--><p class="noindent" >A common question is: why these axioms? For example, why associative but not commutative?
This answer will likely not make sense until later, but here are some comments that may
help.
</p><!--l. 661--><p class="indent" >  One general heuristic is: Whenever you define a new type of general object, there’s always a
balancing act going on. On the one hand, you want to include enough constraints that your
objects are “nice”. On the other hand, if you include too many constraints, then your
definition applies to too few objects.
</p><!--l. 669--><p class="indent" >  So, for example, we include “associative” because that makes our lives easier and most
operations we run into are associative. In particular, associativity is required for the inverse of
an element to necessarily be unique. However we don’t include “commutative”,
because examples below show that there are lots of non-abelian groups we care about.
(But we introduce another name “abelian” because we still want to keep track of
it.)
</p><!--l. 679--><p class="indent" >  Another comment: a good motivation for the inverse axioms is that you get a large amount
of <tspan font-family="cmti" font-size="10">symmetry</tspan>. The set of positive integers with addition is not a group, for example, because
you can’t subtract 6 from 3: some elements are “larger” than others. By requiring an inverse
element to exist, you get rid of this issue. (You also need identity for this; it’s hard to define
inverses without it.)
</p><!--l. 688--><p class="indent" >  Even more abstruse comment: <tspan font-family="cmbx" font-size="10">??</tspan>  shows that groups are actually shadows of the so-called
symmetric groups (defined later, also called permutation groups). This makes rigorous the
notion that “groups are very symmetric”.
