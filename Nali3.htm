<!--l. 61--><p class="noindent" >As far as I can tell, higher math for high-school students comes in two flavors: </p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Someone tells you about the hairy ball theorem in the form “you can’t comb the
     hair on a spherical cat” then doesn’t tell you anything about why it should be
     true, what it means to actually “comb the hair”, or any of the underlying theory,
     leaving you with just some vague notion in your head.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">You take a class and prove every result in full detail, and at some point you stop
     caring about what the professor is saying.</li></ul>
<!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" >Presumably you already know how unsatisfying the first approach is. So the second approach
seems to be the default, but I really think there should be some sort of middle ground
here.
</p><!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >  Unlike university, it is <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">not </span>the purpose of this book to train you to solve exercises or write
proofs<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="Na6.htm#fn1x2"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x5-4001f1"></a> , or
prepare you for research in the field. Instead I just want to show you some interesting
math. The things that are presented should be memorable and worth caring about.
For that reason, proofs that would be included for completeness in any ordinary
textbook are often omitted here, unless there is some idea in the proof which I think is
worth seeing. In particular, I place a strong emphasis over explaining why a theorem
<span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">should </span>be true rather than writing down its proof. This is a recurrent theme of this
book:</p>

<!--l. 109--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Natural explanations supersede proofs.</span></p><!--l. 110--><p class="noindent" ></p>
  </div>
<!--l. 112--><p class="indent" >  My hope is that after reading any particular chapter in Napkin, one might get the following
out of it: </p>
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Knowing what the precise definitions are of the main characters,
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Being acquainted with the few really major examples,
                                                                                
                                                                                
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Knowing the precise statements of famous theorems, and having a sense of why
     they <span 
class="cmti-10x-x-109">should </span>be true.</li></ul>
<!--l. 122--><p class="noindent" >Understanding “why” something is true can have many forms. This is sometimes accomplished
with a complete rigorous proof; in other cases, it is given by the idea of the proof; in still other
cases, it is just a few key examples with extensive cheerleading.
</p><!--l. 128--><p class="indent" >  Obviously this is nowhere near enough if you want to e.g. do research in a field; but if you
are just a curious outsider, I hope that it’s more satisfying than the elevator pitch or
Wikipedia articles. Even if you do want to learn a topic with serious depth, I hope
that it can be a good zoomed-out overview before you really dive in, because in
many senses the choice of material is “what I wish someone had told me before I
started”.
