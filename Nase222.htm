<!--l. 93--><p class="noindent" >So, we have a set Œ© of possible points (which in the context of the previous discussion can be
thought of as the set of worlds), and we want to assign a <tspan font-family="cmti" font-size="10">measure </tspan>(think volume) to subsets of
points in Œ©. We will now describe some of the obstacles that we will face, in order to motivate
<tspan font-family="cmti" font-size="10">how </tspan>measure spaces are defined (as the previous section only motivated <tspan font-family="cmti" font-size="10">why </tspan>we want such
things).
</p><!--l. 102--><p class="indent" >  If you try to do this na√Øvely, you basically immediately run into set-theoretic issues. A
good example to think about why this might happen is if Œ© = <tspan font-family="msbm" font-size="10">‚Ñù</tspan><sup><tspan font-family="cmr" font-size="8">2</tspan></sup> with the measure
corresponding to area. You can define the area of a triangle as in high school, and you can
then try and define the area of a circle, maybe by approximating it with polygons. But what
area would you assign to the subset <tspan font-family="msbm" font-size="10">‚Ñö</tspan><sup><tspan font-family="cmr" font-size="8">2</tspan></sup>, for example? (It turns out ‚Äúzero‚Äù is actually a working
answer.) Or, a unit disk is composed of infinitely many points; each of the points
better have measure zero, but why does their union have measure <tspan font-family="cmmi" font-size="10">œÄ </tspan>then? Blah blah
blah.
</p><!--l. 116--><p class="indent" >  We‚Äôll say more about this later, but you might have already heard of the <tspan font-family="cmbx" font-size="10">Banach-Tarski</tspan>
<tspan font-family="cmbx" font-size="10">paradox </tspan>which essentially shows there is no good way that you can assign a measure to every
single subset of <tspan font-family="msbm" font-size="10">‚Ñù</tspan><sup><tspan font-family="cmr" font-size="8">3</tspan></sup> and still satisfy basic sanity checks. There are just too many possible
subsets of Euclidean space.
</p><!--l. 123--><p class="indent" >  However, the good news is that most of these sets are not ones that we will ever care about,
and it‚Äôs enough to define measures for certain ‚Äúsufficiently nice sets‚Äù. The adjective we will use
is <tspan font-family="cmti" font-size="10">measurable</tspan>, and it will turn out that this will be way, way more than good enough for any
practical purposes.
</p><!--l. 131--><p class="indent" >  We will generally use <tspan font-family="cmmi" font-size="10">A</tspan>, <tspan font-family="cmmi" font-size="10">B</tspan>, ‚Ä¶for measurable sets and denote the entire family of measurable
sets by curly <tspan font-family="rsfs" font-size="10">ùíú  </tspan>.
